# Data Distillery
Repo to support the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) activities with the [Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE)]https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem Data Distillery project. The objective of the Data Distillery project is a knowledge graph that consolidates data assertions across Common Fund (CF) Data Coordinate Centers and facilitates query and discovery.

# Scope and Dependencies
The Data Distillery is considered an implementation of a Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph (UBKG). Scripts for generating the Data Distillery are stored in the [ubkg](https://github.com/dbmi-pitt/UBKG) repo, maintained by DBMI.
